**Project management discussion**

Project management discussions entail the collaborative exchange of ideas and implementation strategies, fostering effective communication among team members and our supervisor to oversee the project's execution. These discussions encompass various aspects such as team meetings, progress tracking utilizing tools like JIRA and GitLab, strategic risk management, problem-solving, and crucial decision-making. Above all, project management discussions emphasise the significance of cooperative teamwork to ensure the project leads to success without any difficulties.


As a team, we agree that our collaboration has been exemplary, contributing to the smooth progression of the project. Our collective effort and our dedication have ensured that tasks are fully completed timely and efficiently. The scrum meetings that we do every Friday have served as valuable touchpoints for aligning our efforts, sharing our progress, making changes if necessary and making decisions to assign them for next week. However, we recognize that there's room for fastening up our progress just in case we are coming to the last weeks before our submission. This situation improved us in various ways such as using our time more effectively, making critical decisions and focusing more on our project. 

We tracked our tasks throughout Jira, in this case, Jira allows us to assign tasks to everyone separately and allows us to follow its progress such as if it’s done or in progress. Also, for our project's progress we used GitLab to keep up with everything. Everybody had their own branch to work on to make the changes and once we agreed on the changes and the tasks were completed, we merged them into the master’s branch most of the time to see the final look of our project. 

Overall, while our teamwork and progress on the project have been remarkable, we never gave up and always kept increasing our performance, increasing the quality of our program, discussing how to make it more reliable and effective and most importantly we never lost our ambition of submitting the perfect project.
