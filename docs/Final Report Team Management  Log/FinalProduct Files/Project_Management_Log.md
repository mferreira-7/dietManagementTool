**Project Management Log**

**Project management discussion**

Project management discussions entail the collaborative exchange of ideas and implementation strategies, fostering effective communication among team members and our supervisor to oversee the project's execution. These discussions encompass various aspects such as team meetings, progress tracking utilizing tools like JIRA and GitLab, strategic risk management, problem-solving, and crucial decision-making. Above all, project management discussions emphasise the significance of cooperative teamwork to ensure the project leads to success without any difficulties.


As a team, we agree that our collaboration has been exemplary, contributing to the smooth progression of the project. Our collective effort and our dedication have ensured that tasks are fully completed timely and efficiently. The scrum meetings that we do every Friday have served as valuable touchpoints for aligning our efforts, sharing our progress, making changes if necessary and making decisions to assign them for next week. However, we recognize that there's room for fastening up our progress just in case we are coming to the last weeks before our submission. This situation improved us in various ways such as using our time more effectively, making critical decisions and focusing more on our project. 

We tracked our tasks throughout Jira, in this case, Jira allows us to assign tasks to everyone separately and allows us to follow its progress such as if it’s done or in progress. Also, for our project's progress we used GitLab to keep up with everything. Everybody had their own branch to work on to make the changes and once we agreed on the changes and the tasks were completed, we merged them into the master’s branch most of the time to see the final look of our project. 

Overall, while our teamwork and progress on the project have been remarkable, we never gave up and always kept increasing our performance, increasing the quality of our program, discussing how to make it more reliable and effective and most importantly we never lost our ambition of submitting the perfect project.

**Burndown-Charts Discussion**

Burndown charts is a key tool in Agile and Scrum methodologies, providing a visual representation of work left to do versus time remaining in a sprint.

**Understanding Burndown Charts:**

- **Work Remaining**: The Y-axis typically represents the amount of work remaining (measured in story points, time, or issue counts).
- **Time**: The X-axis shows the time left in the sprint.
- **Ideal Burndown**: The chart usually includes an 'ideal burndown' line, which represents the expected rate of task completion if the work was evenly distributed throughout the sprint.
- **Actual Progress**: As the team completes tasks, the actual progress line is plotted. This line should ideally track closely to the ideal line.
- **What Burndown Charts Indicate**: Make efficient use of Agile tools that can help in tracking progress and facilitating more accurate estimations.
- **Progress Tracking**: The chart shows at a glance how much work remains and whether the team is on track to complete the sprint goals. Helps with adjusting workload for team memeber who fails to meet sprint goals
- **Reflect on Past Sprints**: Review previous burndown charts to identify patterns. For example, if the team consistently underestimates the complexity of tasks, this insight can be used to adjust future estimates.
- **Regular Retrospectives**: Hold sprint retrospectives to discuss what went well and what didn’t. Focus on estimation accuracy and velocity.
- **Continuous Learning**: Encourage a mindset of continuous improvement. Each sprint should be an opportunity to learn and refine estimation and work processes.

Each team member demonstrates commendable self-discipline, diligently completing their assigned tasks within the specified timelines. The team exhibits strong communication skills, fostering a conflict-free and well-organised working environment. It is crucial to build upon these strengths and maintain effective communication to ensure the continued success of the project.
