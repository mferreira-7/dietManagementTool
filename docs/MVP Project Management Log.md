## Project management discussion

***Include a paragraph or two, agreed by all team members, on how well the group has worked together, and how well the project is progressing.***

Our Scrum meeting is held on a weekly basis, holding a concise communication and clear focus based on the project and asking question such as;

- What did we accomplish this week?
- What are we working on for this week sprint?
- Are there any obstacles impeding our progress? . 


We created a whatsapp group which is where we hold our daily or demand stand-ups, though brief, it is crucial for aligning the team on sprint goals,  tracking progress and engaging withing other team members whenever needed. To enhance efficiency, we maintain a strict weekly time limit, ensure team members come prepared with focused updates, and use in person explanation of every completed task weekly where everyone explain what they have done and achieved to all team members. In additon, all team members are engaging and participating effectively with the help of Jira managing and maintaining the teams goals and objectives.

## Burndown-Charts Discussion

Burndown charts is a key tool in Agile and Scrum methodologies, providing a visual representation of work left to do versus time remaining in a sprint.

## Understanding Burndown Charts:

- **Work Remaining**: The Y-axis typically represents the amount of work remaining (measured in story points, time, or issue counts).
- **Time**: The X-axis shows the time left in the sprint.
- **Ideal Burndown**: The chart usually includes an 'ideal burndown' line, which represents the expected rate of task completion if the work was evenly distributed throughout the sprint.
- **Actual Progress**: As the team completes tasks, the actual progress line is plotted. This line should ideally track closely to the ideal line.
- **What Burndown Charts Indicate**: Make efficient use of Agile tools that can help in tracking progress and facilitating more accurate estimations.
- **Progress Tracking**: The chart shows at a glance how much work remains and whether the team is on track to complete the sprint goals. Helps with adjusting workload for team memeber who fails to meet sprint goals
- **Reflect on Past Sprints**: Review previous burndown charts to identify patterns. For example, if the team consistently underestimates the complexity of tasks, this insight can be used to adjust future estimates.
- **Regular Retrospectives**: Hold sprint retrospectives to discuss what went well and what didnâ€™t. Focus on estimation accuracy and velocity.
- **Continuous Learning**: Encourage a mindset of continuous improvement. Each sprint should be an opportunity to learn and refine estimation and work processes.

## Other Areas (to be decided by the team in lab)
*If your team has anything else they want to demonstrate, e.g. advanced project management tools, reporting graphs with suitable explanation and interpretation, advanced use of Jira (e.g. issue links, epics, versions), or continuous integration tools, then include a summary here.*
