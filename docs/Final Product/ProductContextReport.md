# Product Context


## Legal

As we are technically based in the UK, we should adhere to any laws and regulations that exist in this country and any other country where we would do business.

**Laws and regulations that apply are (and not limited to)**:

- #### UK GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
	To fully comply with the GDPR, we would have to have *Lawful Basis for Processing and Data Minimisation*: The company must have a lawful basis for processing users' personal data and only collecting what we need. Of which, we do as we need to keep track of their data to acheive accurate nutritional reccomendations and we only ask for their dietary intakes and physical characteristics to perform this. 
	*Transparency and Privacy Notices, Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and User Rights* must also be applied and upheld to ensure that; users' rights regarding their data is known, including the right to access their personal data, the right to rectify inaccurate data, the right to erasure (in certain circumstances).

- #### Computer Misuse Act
	A nutritional tracker app with logins and user data should take the these steps for UK law compliance (The ones that apply to us):
	1.  **Access Control** (For logins and Admin tasks)
    
	2.  **Data Encryption** (Keeping logins and data safe)
    
	3.  **User Education** (Liability purposes)
    
	4.  **Monitoring and Logging** (So it is harder for bad actors to be unnoticed)
    
	5.  **Data Backup and Recovery** (So no user has to lose data)
    
	6.  **Compliance with Third-party Services** (Our uuse of CalorieNinjas API should be secure)

Some of these points have, admittedly, not been met by our group. But if time was not a factor, they can be implemented easily and with little effort.

### **API usage: CalorieNinjas**

*The program makes use of one API for it's core functionality.*
If we decide to make this product commercial, we have to discuss licensing, API calls per month and the amount of allowed users. As currently, our API usage is only limited to personal use.

###**Software Licensing**

A proprietary software license would allow for us to make the app without fear of our time and effort being stolen. In terms of the size of our team, it is very small so we have to focus on building features and functionality that align with their vision and the needs of their target users, without being constrained by the requirements of open-source licenses or community contributions. For us to be profitable, the proprieatary license would allow us to monetise the app too.

	


## Ethical
1.  **Accuracy and Reliability**: When making a nutrition tracker, we should aim to provide accurate and reliable information to users. As if inaccurate data or recommendations are given, it could lead to misguided dietary decisions, potentially impacting users' health negatively. Our team have an ethical responsibility to ensure that the information provided by the app is based on credible sources and scientific evidence and it won't jeopardize users' health.
    
2.  **Potential for Obsessive Behavior**: Users could potentially develop an obsessive behavior or an unhealthy relationship with food and exercise as a result of using a nutrition tracker app. Features or guidance to promote balanced and sustainable approaches to health and wellness, while not encouraging extreme behaviors should be incorporated.

## Health and Safety
Excessive attention to monitoring nutritional intake and exercise can lead to physical health risks like orthorexia nervosa or overtraining syndrome, as users may push themselves too far to reach dietary or exercise goals, resulting in fatigue, injury, or other complications.

Constantly monitoring food intake and exercise can also lead to mental health problems like anxiety, stress, or disordered eating behaviors. Users may feel guilt or shame if they don't achieve tracking goals, causing negative self-esteem or body image issues.

Users could develop an excessive dependency on the app in controlling their diet and exercise schedules, resulting in a decreased sense of self-sufficiency in making healthy decisions. Relying too heavily on the app could hinder users from tuning into their body's natural cues about hunger, satiety, and physical activity.

## Equality, diversity, and inclusion statement: 
In Marketing and Promotion Representation: The team should make sure marketing materials and promotions include a diverse range of individuals, such as various ages, genders, races, ethnicities, body types, and abilities, to show a commitment to equality and inclusivity.

For Team 50, our team is VERY diverse. Having a diverse team composition means having individuals from various backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives on the project team. Their different viewpoints and insights lead to more creative and inclusive solutions. Providing opportunities for underrepresented groups like women and minorities in engineering promotes equality and diversity in the field.
